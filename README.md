# OVERVIEW

Turn your browser into an organized library! This extension acts like a personal bookshelf for your browser. Save your open pages, arrange them like books on a shelf, and instantly revisit them whenever you need. Download it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bookshelf/bmgphchchbdajdapnomkmbhiolapbple).


# FEATURES

An enhanced version of [OneTab](https://www.one-tab.com/) where you can more easily change the order of your saved pages and also split them into multiple instances based on different conceptual areas (here called 'shelves').
